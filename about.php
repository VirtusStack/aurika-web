<!-- FOUNDER MESSAGE -->
<section class="py-5 bg-light">
  <div class="container">

    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">From the Founder</h2>

    <p>
      As a finance and tax professional with over two decades of experience,
      I observed the growing gap between academic education and industry
      requirements, particularly in the field of Chartered Accountancy.
      Overcrowded coaching institutions, lack of personal mentoring and limited
      practical exposure inspired the conception of Aurika Knowledge Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Foundation integrates CA education, graduation programs, articleship,
      vocational training and extracurricular development under one roof,
      creating a holistic learning ecosystem that prepares students for real
      world challenges.
    </p>

      Director, Aurika Knowledge Foundation
