<!-- FOUNDER MESSAGE -->

      <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">From the Founder</h2>

      <p>
        With over two decades of experience in finance and taxation, I observed a
        widening gap between academic education and industry expectations,
        particularly in Chartered Accountancy education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aurika Knowledge Foundation was conceived to integrate CA education,
        graduation programs, articleship, vocational training and holistic
        development under one ecosystem — preparing students for real-world
        challenges.
      </p>
